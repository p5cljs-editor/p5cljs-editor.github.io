# Tutorial

Hi! Nice to see that you want to learn more about ClojureScript. Firstly, you
should know how to write p5 sketches before doing this quick tutorial.
Otherwise, you should checkout p5's own [getting started
tutorial](https://p5js.org/get-started/).

This is a quick tutorial to get you started writing p5 sketches in
ClojureScript and learn more about the Clojure/ClojureScript language.

## Basics

```clj
(defn setup []
  (js/hello))
```
